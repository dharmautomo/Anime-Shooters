## Overview
Implement a complete weapons system that includes guns, shooting mechanics, ammunition management, player health, and visual effects.

## Core Requirements

### Player Weapon Display
- Implement a first-person view that shows the player's current weapon
- Position the weapon in the lower right portion of the screen, properly aligned with the camera
- Create smooth weapon sway animation while walking/running
- Add weapon bob effect during movement
- Include weapon lowering animation when sprinting

### Multiplayer Weapon Visualization
- Display appropriate weapon models on other players' characters
- Ensure weapon positioning looks natural in third-person view
- Synchronize weapon animations (shooting, reloading) across the network
- Implement proper weapon handling animations for other players

### Shooting Mechanics
- Implement shooting functionality using:
  - Left mouse button click
  - J key press
  - K key press
- Add screen shake effect when firing weapons

### Projectile Visualization
- Create visible bullet projectiles when a weapon is fired
- Implement bullet trails/tracers for better visualization
- Add bullet impact effects on different surfaces (wall, ground, player)
- Include bullet drop and travel time for realistic ballistics

### Visual Effects
- Implement muzzle flash effect when firing
  - Create particle system for the flash
  - Add appropriate light emission during firing
- Add smoke effects from the barrel after firing
- Include shell ejection animation and sound
- Create camera kickback effect when firing

### Health and Scoring System
- Implement player health system (0-100 points)
- Display health bar/indicator in the HUD
- Add visual feedback when taking damage (screen flash, blood splatter effect)
- When health reaches zero:
  - Play death animation
  - Disable player controls
  - Implement respawn system with countdown timer
  - Reset health to full upon respawn
- Scoring system:
  - Add 1 point to player's score for each successful hit on another player
  - Display score prominently in the HUD
  - Add visual/audio feedback when scoring a hit (distinctive sound, score counter animation)
  - Implement score persistence between respawns

### Ammunition System
- Implement ammunition counter in the HUD
- Decrease ammo count by 1 for each shot fired
- When ammo reaches zero:
  - Disable firing capability
  - Display "Empty" indicator or play click sound
- Implement reload functionality with R key press
- Add reload animation with appropriate timing
- Include partial reload logic (keeping bullets in chamber)

### User Interface Elements
- Create ammo counter display showing current magazine/total ammo
- Add health bar/indicator
- Implement hit markers when successfully hitting enemies
- Add score counter that updates in real-time:
  - Show player's current score
  - Implement score animation/highlighting when score increases

### Controls Guide
- Add the on-screen controls guide during initial loading:
  ```
  CONTROLS:
  • SHOOT: Left Mouse Button, J, or K
  • RELOAD: R
  ```

## Technical Implementation Guidelines

### Weapon System Architecture
- Create a modular weapon class system that handles:
  - Weapon properties (damage, fire rate, ammo capacity)
  - Weapon state management
  - Firing and reload logic

### Network Considerations
- Synchronize weapon state across all clients
- Implement server authority for damage calculation
- Use prediction for responsive local feedback
- Add reconciliation for accurate multiplayer experience

### Performance Optimization
- Use object pooling for bullets and effects
- Implement level of detail (LOD) for weapon models
- Optimize particle effects for performance
- Use instancing for bullet rendering when appropriate

## Asset Requirements

### 3D Models
- Detailed first-person weapon models
- Third-person weapon models (potentially lower poly)
- Ammunition models for reload visualization
- Shell casing models

### Textures
- High-resolution weapon textures
- Normal maps for detailed weapon rendering
- Emission maps for muzzle flash
- Blood splatter textures

### Sounds
- Weapon firing sounds
- Empty magazine click
- Reload sounds (magazine out, magazine in, chamber)
- Impact sounds (different per surface)
- Player damage/hurt sounds
- Death sounds
- Low ammo indicator sound
